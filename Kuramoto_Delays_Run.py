    # Function to run simulations of coupled systems using the
    # KURAMOTO MODEL OF COUPLED OSCILLATORS WITH TIME DELAYS

    # - Each node is represented by a Phase Oscillator
    # - with Natural Frequency f
    # - coupled according to a  connectivity matrix C
    # - with a distance matrix D (scaled to delays by the mean delay MD)
